1. The base of a number system tells you how many digits there are and the place values. For base 14, there are 14 digits, |{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D}|=14, and the place values are increment powers of 14, 14^3 14^2 14^1 14^0 for a 4 place number.

2. Some advantages of using binary digital electronics over analog electronics 
Binary digital electronics are easier to copy data from. Since they use data in binary form, it can be copied over easily without any loss in quality.
Binary digital electronics have more precision. It is in binary rather than a range of numbers.
Binary digital electronics can store the same amount in a smaller area. Example: Analog clocks take up a lot of space. Digital clocks can show time on a smaller screen.

3. Fetch: go to RAM and get instructions. Send instruction to IR and add 4 to PC. PC points to the address of the next instruction.
Decode: IR's instructions are passed to the CTL, which decodes the instructions.
Execute: ALU executes the instructions.
